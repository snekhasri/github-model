o your choices are to actually commit an image to your repository, and then try and figure out the path to the raw image and use that. Or host your image somewhere else. Neither is a great option. Thankfully, there’s one cool trick that will let you stick with using GitHub in the browser and not only will let you add images to your content but even supports copy-paste!


Copy the generated markdown from the image into your markdown file or wiki page. You can of course change the generic [image] to something more reflective of the image, as this is used for the alt tag.
Repeat as needed. You can close the issue and keep it around for additional images in the future, or just abandon it and never save it. Uploaded images on an issue that is never saved are still retained. You can also use the same trick in comments on issues, so you could easily just add one comment per image you need to add as well.

The only annoying thing about this process is that anybody who is following your repository is going to get an email every time you add a comment to an issue or update it, so if you’re going to be creating a lot of images you might do it in a batch before saving or closing the issue (and instead of adding 1 per comment).
